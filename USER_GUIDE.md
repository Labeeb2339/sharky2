## 🦈 Understanding Shark Habitats

### What Makes a Good Shark Habitat?

#### 🌡️ **Water Temperature**
Different shark species prefer different temperatures:
- **Great Whites**: Cool waters (12-24°C) - like California coast
- **Tiger Sharks**: Warm tropical waters (20-30°C) - like Hawaii
- **Bull Sharks**: Very warm waters (22-32°C) - like Florida

#### 🐟 **Food Availability (Prey)**
Sharks need food! We analyze:
- **Chlorophyll levels**: More chlorophyll = more plankton = more fish = more sharks
- **Ocean productivity**: Areas where the food chain is most active
- **Seasonal patterns**: When and where food is most abundant

#### 🌊 **Ocean Features**
- **Thermal fronts**: Temperature boundaries where different water masses meet
- **Upwelling zones**: Areas where deep, nutrient-rich water rises to the surface
- **Ocean currents**: Highways that sharks use for migration

#### 🏔️ **Depth & Seafloor**
- **Continental shelves**: Shallow areas where many sharks hunt
- **Seamounts**: Underwater mountains that attract marine life
- **Drop-offs**: Steep underwater cliffs where sharks ambush prey

## 🔧 Tips & Tricks

### Getting the Best Results

#### 🎯 **Choose the Right Species for Your Location**
- **Tropical areas**: Tiger Shark, Bull Shark, Great Hammerhead
- **Temperate areas**: Great White Shark, Blue Shark
- **Open ocean**: Shortfin Mako, Blue Shark
- **Coastal areas**: Great White, Tiger, Bull Shark

#### 📅 **Pick the Right Time Period**
- **Current conditions**: Use recent 1-7 days
- **Seasonal patterns**: Compare same months across years
- **Migration timing**: Analyze 2-4 week periods
- **Climate studies**: Use multiple years of data

#### 🗺️ **Size Your Study Area Appropriately**
- **Small areas** (50-100 km): High detail, current conditions
- **Medium areas** (200-500 km): Regional patterns, seasonal analysis
- **Large areas** (1000+ km): Migration routes, climate patterns

### Interpreting Results

#### 🟢 **High Suitability Areas**
Look for combinations of:
- Optimal temperature for your species
- High food availability (chlorophyll)
- Thermal fronts or upwelling
- Appropriate depth ranges

#### 🔴 **Low Suitability Areas**
Usually caused by:
- Water too hot or too cold
- Very low food availability
- Inappropriate depths (too deep/shallow)
- Poor water quality conditions

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No data available for this region/time"
- Try a different time period (some areas have seasonal data gaps)
- Expand your study area slightly
- Check if the location is over land (sharks need water!)

#### "Analysis taking too long"
- Reduce the size of your study area
- Use a shorter time period
- Check your internet connection

#### "Token expired" error
- Your NASA access token needs renewal
- See [Token Setup Guide](NASA_TOKEN_SETUP.md) for renewal instructions
- Tokens typically last 60-90 days

### Getting Help
- Check the [Token Setup Guide](NASA_TOKEN_SETUP.md) for access issues
- Review the [Species Guide](SPECIES_GUIDE.md) for species-specific tips
- Visit NASA Earthdata support for data access questions
